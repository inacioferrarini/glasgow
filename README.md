# What is it?
Glasgow is a basic set of classes, designed to work well together or not.
Every class has one responsibility and one responsibility only, being fully adherent to S.O.L.I.D. principles.

# Goals
* Dramatically reduce ViewControllers' size.
* Provide an easy project startup and reduce project startup time.
* Through the usage of a well designed base classes, provide a standard that will keep the project as standardized as possible.

This way, glasgow is divided in five domains (subspecs):
* Core: Basic elements used by more specific domain.
* Networking: Basic Api consuption.
* Transformer: Basic value transformation classes.
* UIKit: UIKit related classes.
* Arrow: Extension using 'Arrow' to generically convert ArrowParseable objects.

## Requirements
* iOS 8.0+

Glasgow is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
